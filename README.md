# hospital_timetable

## DESCRIPTION
Hospital timetable is one of the projects in my second year of a computer science degree.  It was carried out in groups of 6 over 2 months. 
It's a hospital timetable application that lets you add/modify/delete/consult staff, create a timetable with different slots, consult the timetable globally and weekly or by staff, and consult legal/speciality constraints whether they're respected or not. Staff functions and specialities can also be consulted.
